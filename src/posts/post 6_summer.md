This past week I meet with Professors Luman and Mehler, my first and second readers, about my project idea. After my computer science junior seminar, I was still concerned about the qualifications that my project idea needed to meet. I set up a virtual meeting and talked about some of the ways my project could go. 

Professor Luman also sent me an old copy of the Informatics senior project guidelines and requirements. It is three pages long but here are the parts that I found important. 

- Engagement with data and/or systems of data production to reveal underlying patterns, narratives, or trends, resulting in an original scholarly argument. 
    - The data part of the project would still be the light plot data sheets. As well as any data in the text that would affect the show. Ex. *They were running through the forest.* So I should add green light with a tree gobo.
    - The data part of the after project will be the guidelines, notes, and instructions on my findings. 
- Critical understanding of contemporary and historical contexts that exert influence on the specific subjects under examination.
    - I am already doing research on how the Augment3d system works. I will be looking more into it during the summer.
