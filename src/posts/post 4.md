**Overall vision for my project as of right now.**

Hardware:
The hardware necessary is any monitor to show the software that is already built into the system in the Vulk. I do still need to get into the Vulk to see what hardware they have. Also if it is something like a MAC, to see if I could use something else that I am more familiar with. Or does it not matter?

Tools:
Thankfully all the software needed for this project is in the Vulk. All of the libraries and things used to create the virtual stage and add the lights to make each cue are in the Augment3d part of the system. Mehler also said we can get more stuff if we need to get more lights, a VR headset, or other boards to run this.

Skills:
I have taken the lighting class offered here at Allegheny and set up the lights for a show. I also was the light board operator for that show. This is good for this project so that I can be the light board operator for whatever show I light. (This is not an unfair placement. Almost every season, senior theatre majors/minors get cast in shows or get to direct shows just because they are doing their comp on it. I am doing the same thing however I am not taking on a role that will affect the majority of the show.) I have also designed and run the lights for some dance recitals on campus. This helped me know how to design the lights for a show. I was asked to be the light designer the night before the performance so I had to ask the dancers in each piece what their dance is about and see them dance it to design the lights for their show the next day.

Data:
If you are looking at the light cues or anything in VR as data, then yes. I will be making the light cues in the VR and once they are approved by the director, then I will store them. Probably on a card or flash drive. Otherwise no, as of right now, I do not believe my project will work with real hard data.

Time: 
Honestly, like most theatre senior projects, I believe this project can be done in one semester.

Take one semester: I would prefer the spring semester. I have soccer in the fall and the spring season for theatre would have a better show to light. I would start before the casting of the show and talk to whoever is directing the show and get some ideas for lighting the show that the director has. This would be late December, early January. Then as the process goes on, I would use Augment3d to render up some basic cues for the show and see if I am on the right track. This would be around late February. Once the light cues are perfected, I would then ask if the director and cast want to use the light cues in real life to rehearse with. This part of the project usually doesn't happen in the theatre process. I would then come in during the tech week and implement the light cues into real life for the final show around late March early April. I can then right my paper during and after the process and have my project done within one semester.

Takes two-semester: I would have a lot more time which may help if problems come up then I would have time to fix them. I do have soccer in the fall semester but if I have all year then I can spread it out. I would also be able to pick what theatre season is better light fall shows or spring. I do not know if I would be able to be the light board operator or as involved if it is a fall show. But I might not need to be.

Results: 
My final product will be the performances that I light. I will be the light board operator and will see if every show goes efficiently or not. I can even ask some of the cast and directors that were a part of the process and see how my new way of lighting affected the overall performance process. I will also have the light cues on a drive and can run them/take screenshots of them with each cue to show my results. Maybe I can even show them in VR.

Analysis: 
I can have Professor Mehler and anyone else who knows about lighting to analyze my project and talk about my whole process including the performance.

Other abilities and resources: 
My project is pretty sound. If I need to modify it at all then I will. I do not see myself doing another different project especially because of how involved a lot of people are already. My “backup” would be shifting to a helper project if the VR doesn't work out. My project will be more about making the lighting process smoother for everyone. Which is already my goal.

Threats to Validity: 
I do not believe my project has any of this. The only thing that might get in the way is the theatre department not being totally cooperative. Specifically a student not wanting to choose a light heavy show versus one they have wanted to do for a while. I believe I could come to an agreement if something like this happens. I have seen a show with multiple students doing their comps in roles that are directors or actors or something like that and I know it is possible but I know that they can get picky with who is “in charge”.
