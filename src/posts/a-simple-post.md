**This Post is about what type of software is needed to run Augment3d**

The ETC Ion Classic Operations Manual has a table of context. In it is an Augment3d tab where it shows Hardware and Software Requirements. There it talks about the console requirements if you are using a PC or a Mac vs an iOS or Android system. It also has pictures of how to run Augment3d on MAC or Android.

This screen shot of the ETC manual shows how many different systems the software can work with regarding Augment3d. This is very good news for me and I plan on meeting with Professor Mehler and getting inside the Vulk to see what exactly we could potentially do.

 I know that there is a MAC monitor/system that is used but also a regular monitor. Regardless, whatever the Vulk has should be efficient enough for me to do a project.
