The ETC Ion Classic Operations Manual has a table of context. In it is an Augment3d tab where it shows Hardware and Software Requirements. There it talks about the console requirements if you are using a PC or a Mac vs an iOS or Android system. It also has pictures of how to run Augment3d on MAC or Android.

 I know that there is a MAC monitor/system that is used but also a regular monitor. Regardless, whatever the Vulk has should be efficient enough for me to do a project.

This screen shot of the ETC manual shows how many different systems the software can work with regarding Augment3d. This is very good news for me and I plan on meeting with Professor Mehler and getting inside the Vulk to see what exactly we could potentially do.
