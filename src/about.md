I am Griffin Wirth. I'm an [Integrative Informatics Major](https://catalog.allegheny.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=39&poid=3380&returnto=1251) and a [Theatre Minor](https://catalog.allegheny.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=39&poid=3389&returnto=1251) at Allegheny College. For our senior project at our school we need to make a project that is based around our interests, major, and minor. The classes that have stuck with me throughout my years at Allegheny are [Robotics](https://catalog.allegheny.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=39&coid=26536)for Integrative Informatics, and [Lighting Design and Production](https://catalog.allegheny.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=39&coid=27632) for Theatre. 

I have been in some productions here at Allegheny College. I was a light board operator for the show *Proof*, where I got inside experience on the production process that the light board operator and the lighting director go through together for each show from start to end.

With that in mind, I want to use computer science to help the lighting director at Allegheny in pre production for the shows we put on here. I want the coloration between the Director and the Lighting director be closer. Ad knock down any barriers that might be there due to a director not having any background in lighting to correctly collaborate with each other.
